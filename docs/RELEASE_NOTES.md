# Release Notes — Bookable

Portfolio-facing log: what got built and why it's a genuine engineering artifact,
not scaffolding. Written for "walk me through something you built" — pair with
`docs/PROGRESS.md` (the mechanical build log: decisions, what was left behind)
and `docs/reviews/03-slot-engine-spec.md` (the deepest technical spec in the repo).

Updated once per backlog item, same cadence as `PROGRESS.md`.

## A-001 — Monorepo & app scaffold

**What it is:** Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript in `apps/web`, Prisma +
Postgres in `packages/db`, the pure-function domain core in `packages/core`,
npm workspaces tying them together. Playwright + axe for e2e/accessibility.
CI that migrates a throwaway Postgres from scratch (drift check) and runs the
unit suite under two timezones.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **CI runs the test suite twice, under `TZ=UTC` and `TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati`**
  (UTC+14, the calendar's extreme edge) and asserts identical results. A
  UTC-only CI is the single most common way a timezone bug ships silently —
  this repo's CI is built to make that impossible from commit one, before a
  single time-handling line exists.
- **Postgres from commit one, not "SQLite for now."** The project's core
  correctness guarantee (no double-booked appointments) is a database
  exclusion constraint (`EXCLUDE ... WITH &&`), which SQLite cannot express
  and cannot meaningfully race-test (one writer per file makes the concurrency
  test measure the storage engine, not the code). Choosing the harder-to-set-up
  database was the correct engineering call, not the default one.
- **Local Postgres for every test run, zero exceptions.** `.env.test`
  overrides only the database URL and inherits everything else from
  `.env.local` — a deliberate first-file-wins `dotenv` layering, not an
  accident of config order.
- **One fixed port, in config, never on the command line.** `next dev -p 3300`
  is written into `package.json`, not passed as an env var — the failure mode
  it avoids (two projects silently testing against each other's dev server
  because Playwright adopted whatever was already listening on the shared
  default port) is a real incident from a sibling build in this series.

---

## A-002 — The time module (`packages/core/time`)

**What it is:** The single module in the codebase permitted to convert between
the two time axes, plus the branded types that make every other conversion a
compile error.

**The core idea, in one sentence:** a working-hours rule ("I work Tuesdays 9–5")
and an appointment ("Alice's cut, 09:00 on Mar 15") are *different kinds of
thing* — the first is wall-clock, the second is a point on the physical
timeline — and conflating them is the root cause of essentially every
scheduling bug.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **The function signature encodes a mathematical fact most code gets wrong.**
  `resolve(day, time, zone)` does **not** return an instant. It returns
  `unique | gap | ambiguous`, because the local→instant map is neither
  injective nor total: on 2026-03-08 in America/Chicago, `02:30` names *no*
  instant; on 2026-11-01, `01:30` names *two*. Any function typed
  `(wallTime, zone) => Instant` is lying, and every call site is forced by the
  type system to decide what it does about the days when the clock isn't a
  bijection.
- **A real API-removal problem, solved from first principles.** The obvious
  way to detect ambiguity — Temporal's `getPossibleInstantsFor` — is gone in
  `temporal-polyfill` v1. The obvious fallback (compare the `earlier` and
  `later` disambiguation results) *silently doesn't work*: a gap and an
  ambiguity both yield two instants an offset apart, in the same order. The
  implemented discriminator is a round-trip — an ambiguous local time converts
  back to the time you asked for, a nonexistent one doesn't. Worth walking
  through in an interview because the wrong version passes a careless test.
- **Branded types make the sibling project's real production bug
  unrepresentable.** A prior build stored a calendar day in a Postgres `date`
  column; `date → JS Date → format in local zone` shifted it a day west, with
  ten passing tests. Here `CalendarDay` and `Instant` are structurally
  incompatible at compile time, and `@db.Date` is banned repo-wide — the fix
  is a type system, not a code review habit.
- **Enforced by lint, not by discipline.** `temporal-polyfill` is confined to
  this one directory by `no-restricted-imports` (the engine core is deliberately
  library-free integer arithmetic on epoch millis — DST-proof by construction);
  `new Date(string)`, `Date.parse`, `getHours/setHours`,
  `toISOString().slice(0,10)` and `getTimezoneOffset` are `no-restricted-syntax`
  errors repo-wide. After this item the codebase has **zero** `Date.parse` call
  sites and the ban has no exceptions.
- **Tests written before the implementation, against externally-verified
  values.** 29 tests, every expected UTC instant lifted verbatim from a spec
  document where they were verified by execution against the IANA tzdata —
  not re-derived by hand, which is how a test comes to agree with a wrong
  implementation. Includes the cases that break whole-hour assumptions:
  Lord Howe's **30-minute** DST shift and Kathmandu's **+05:45** offset.
- **Verified timezone-independent by execution**, not by assertion: the suite
  produces identical results under `TZ=UTC`, `TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati` (UTC+14),
  `TZ=America/Chicago` and `TZ=Asia/Kathmandu`.

---

## A-003 — The data model and the no-double-booking invariant

**What it is:** 22 tables, and one `EXCLUDE USING gist` constraint that makes
overlapping appointments *unrepresentable* rather than merely checked-for.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **The correctness guarantee is in the database, not the application.** The
  headline requirement — "zero accidental double-bookings" — is enforced by a
  partial GiST exclusion constraint on `(providerId, tstzrange(blockedStart,
  blockedEnd, '[)'))`. Every code path is refused: the ORM, a migration, a
  script, a `psql` session at 2am. The tests prove this by writing with a raw
  Postgres client that knows nothing about the application's rules — an
  ORM-level test would only prove the ORM behaves.
- **`READ COMMITTED` with no retry loop, and that's a consequence, not a
  shortcut.** Because the constraint exists, two concurrent overlapping inserts
  resolve correctly without `SERIALIZABLE` and without the retry wrapper that
  `40001` would force. The alternative design (SELECT-then-INSERT) is textbook
  write skew and needs all of that machinery — machinery that, untested, is a
  liability of its own.
- **Half-open intervals, and why that's the single most important character.**
  The range is `'[)'`. With `'[]'`, back-to-back appointments abut at a shared
  endpoint and are rejected as conflicts — the salon could never book
  consecutive clients, which is most of a working day. There is an explicit
  test asserting back-to-back is *allowed*.
- **Six Postgres behaviours verified by execution rather than assumed**, because
  the spec flagged them as unverified and each one costs a day: generated
  columns are impossible here (`timestamptz + interval` is `STABLE`, not
  `IMMUTABLE`, and Postgres rejects the column outright); `EXTRACT(EPOCH ...)`
  *is* immutable so a whole-minute CHECK is legal; `btree_gist` is mandatory;
  and the append-only trigger surfaces `23001`, not the `2F004` I first guessed
  — the test caught that.
- **The ORM hides the error you most need to catch.** Prisma surfaces the
  exclusion violation as `PrismaClientUnknownRequestError` with **`code`
  undefined** — not `P2002` — with the SQLSTATE only inside the message string.
  The natural `e.code === 'P2002'` check silently falls through to a 500 while
  the race test still passes: the concurrency is correct and the user
  experience is broken. Verified and pinned with a test.
- **A structural fix for a real defect from a sibling build.** That project
  added a status to an enum and four separate readers silently kept the old
  list. Here every status list derives from one module, and a test reads the
  *live* constraint definition out of `pg_constraint` and asserts it still
  matches — so the SQL and the TypeScript cannot drift apart without going red.
- **Staff can override; customers still cannot collide.** A knowing staff
  double-book writes a zero-width range, which satisfies the constraint without
  weakening it, while the true intended range is preserved in a separate column
  for the day view and the availability engine. The constraint never lies, and
  a customer booking the overridden time is still refused — both asserted.

---

## A-008 — The slot engine

**What it is:** One pure function — `computeSlots(query) -> slots` — that answers
"when can this client book this service with this provider on this day?"
correctly on the two days a year when the clock is not a bijection.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **It is a pure function, and that is a design decision with teeth.** No I/O, no
  clock, no ambient timezone: `now` is a parameter. That is what makes a
  daylight-saving bug reproducible in a unit test in June instead of being
  discovered by a customer in March.
- **Integer arithmetic on the physical axis, deliberately library-free.** Wall
  clock times are converted to instants exactly once, at the window edges, and
  everything after that — grid stepping, overlap tests, buffer maths — is
  integer epoch-millisecond comparison. The physical axis has no DST, so the
  hot loop is DST-proof by construction. A lint rule enforces that the Temporal
  library cannot be imported into the engine at all.
- **The subtlest bug in the codebase, and the test that catches it.** On
  spring-forward morning a provider's hours may be stored as two rows
  (01:00–02:00 and 03:00–04:00) because 02:00 does not exist. Those must union
  into ONE continuous three-hour window on the instant axis — if the code
  resolves the 02:00 close to the instant *before* the gap instead of after, it
  sees a phantom one-hour hole and silently refuses every appointment long
  enough to span it. The engine takes the later instant for both edges, and a
  mutation test proves the suite catches the alternative.
- **The doubled hour is treated as real capacity.** On fall-back day 01:00–01:59
  happens twice; naive implementations deduplicate by wall-clock label and
  silently delete an hour of bookable, revenue-generating time. Here both
  occurrences are offered as distinct slots carrying distinct offsets, and
  policy decides whether to show both — a business decision, made explicitly,
  rather than a default inherited from a date library.
- **Exclusions are explained, and that's a testing argument, not a UX one.**
  Almost every assertion about a scheduling engine is an assertion of absence,
  and `expect(slots).not.toContain('11:00')` passes if you typo the date, if the
  fixture has no hours, or if the engine threw and you swallowed it. The engine
  reports *why* each candidate was rejected, so tests assert
  `reasons == ['overlaps-buffer']` — which fails when the mechanism is wrong
  even though the outcome looks right. Explanations are suppressed on public
  routes, because "overlaps-booking" tells an anonymous visitor exactly when
  the provider is with a client.
- **58 engine tests: a hand-built edge matrix plus 21 property tests.** The
  properties assert the laws (a returned slot never overlaps a busy interval;
  adding a booking never *adds* availability; increasing duration never adds a
  slot) across thousands of generated queries weighted toward the transition
  days and a leap day.
- **The property tests were themselves validated two ways** — because a property
  test that silently generates empty results passes everything and proves
  nothing. First, generator sanity: 500 queries, 245 with non-empty results, up
  to 154 slots. Second, mutation testing: three deliberate bugs injected into
  the engine, all three caught.

---

## A-004 — The notification seam

**What it is:** one path every outbound notification goes through —
`enqueueNotification()` decides and records, `dispatchPendingNotifications()`
sends — built before anything in the product actually needs to send a
message.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **Built in the wrong order on purpose.** The confirmation email doesn't
  exist yet; this does. Building the seam first, rather than retrofitting it
  once three call sites have already hand-rolled their own sending, is a
  structural decision carried over from a defect in a sibling project.
- **A kill switch that is still honest while it's off.** Setting
  `NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false` doesn't skip writing the outbox row — it
  writes the row and marks it suppressed, with a reason. "What would have
  gone out during the incident" stays answerable, which a switch that simply
  skips the write cannot do. Verified that flipping the switch mid-backlog
  halts everything already queued, not just future decisions.
- **A sandbox redirect that never contaminates the record.** Point
  `NOTIFICATIONS_SANDBOX_TO` at a test inbox and every send goes there — but
  the outbox row keeps the real, intended recipient. A staging environment
  can exercise the entire path against real-looking client data and still
  never reach an actual phone number.
- **Idempotency proven, not just implemented.** Two enqueue calls with the
  same dedupe key produce exactly one row — verified with a *second* call
  carrying a *different* payload, confirming the first decision wins outright
  rather than merely deduplicating on later fields.
- **A dual-timezone test run caught a real bug that had nothing to do with
  time.** Adding this item's database-backed test file made the *previous*
  item's test file fail too — under both `TZ=UTC` and `TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati`,
  with two different failure counts. It looked exactly like the class of bug
  this project's whole CI design exists to catch. It wasn't one: two test
  files sharing a local Postgres database, both truncating tables in
  parallel, produced a genuine Postgres deadlock. Diagnosed by isolating each
  file (both pass alone) before touching any code, then fixed at the config
  level so it can't recur for the next database test file either.

---

## A-005 — Staff session and the audit actor

**What it is:** password hashing, a signed session cookie, and a route guard —
built with the Node standard library and no auth dependency.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **The scope decision is the interesting one.** A sibling project in this
  series runs NextAuth with full role-based access control. Here the recorded
  decision is deliberately "one shared credential, real session, actor stamped
  on every mutation — and multi-user roles are explicitly a later phase."
  Knowing which one a product needs *this month* is the judgment; building the
  larger thing by reflex is the common failure.
- **No auth library, and a reason rather than a preference.** Nothing a JWT
  library offers — algorithm negotiation, JWKS, third-party verification —
  applies when one server signs a cookie and the same server verifies it.
  What is used instead: HMAC-SHA256 from `node:crypto`, with the expiry
  *inside* the signature so it can't be extended by editing the cookie.
- **Password hashing done properly, in ~40 lines.** scrypt with a random
  per-password salt, constant-time comparison, OWASP-floor cost parameters,
  and a self-describing stored format (`scrypt$N$r$p$salt$hash`) so the cost
  can be raised later without invalidating existing hashes or locking anyone
  out.
- **The login form is not a user directory.** An unknown email and a wrong
  password return the same message *and take the same time* — the
  user-not-found branch verifies against a dummy hash specifically so it pays
  the same ~100ms of deliberate scrypt work. There's a test for it, asserted
  as a ratio rather than an absolute millisecond bound, because a tight timing
  assertion on shared CI hardware is a flake generator.
- **Session revocation with no revocation list.** The guard re-reads the staff
  row on every request instead of trusting the cookie's contents, so deleting
  a user invalidates their live sessions immediately — no denylist to keep,
  no TTL to wait out.
- **The security properties are asserted end-to-end, not assumed.** Playwright
  specs prove an anonymous visitor never renders the protected content (not
  merely has it hidden), that a *tampered* cookie is rejected rather than
  trusted, and that the real cookie carries `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` and
  `Secure` — the last one checked against a production build, because a
  regression to `secure: false` is invisible locally and ships the session
  cookie in clear text everywhere else.
- **What was deliberately left undone, and written down.** There is no rate
  limiter on login yet; scrypt's cost is the only brute-force control. That's
  defensible for one credential on a single-tenant v1 and indefensible if it
  goes unremarked, so it's recorded in the code and the log with the specific
  upgrade path — a later item already needs the same limiter for a different
  route, so it gets built once and shared.

---

## A-025 — Business & provider setup

**What it is:** owner-configurable business policy and the provider roster,
built around one specific trap the previous milestone's operator review
surfaced.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **A real trap, closed by construction rather than by a form hint.** The
  product's cancellation-cutoff rule was specified as "startup validation" —
  but a later decision let each individual service override the cutoff, and
  startup validation cannot catch a pair created by editing either side after
  the fact. Set a service's cutoff longer than the business lead time — both
  individually reasonable settings — and a client can book a slot she is
  structurally unable to cancel, then get charged a late-cancellation fee she
  had no way to avoid, counted by the product's own no-show tracking. Fixed by
  making the invariant a shared pure function, called from both write paths,
  that names the offending service in the error.
- **Domain-accurate error messages, and a test that enforces it.** A duration
  formatter deliberately renders "24 hours" rather than "1 day" for a
  cancellation policy, because that's how the trade actually states one — and
  a test pins the exact wording so a refactor can't silently drift it back to
  the technically-correct-but-tone-deaf version.
- **A seed built to expose bugs, not hide them.** The setup seed gives one
  provider a split shift, gives everyone but one a midday break, and makes one
  provider unqualified for half the catalog — because a seed where every
  provider works identical hours and does every service makes entire
  categories of bug invisible to every screen built against it afterward.

---

## A-006 — Service catalog

**What it is:** service CRUD, per-provider duration/price overrides, and
deactivation that never deletes — with the confirmation gate proven against a
real row rather than assumed to work.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **A gate tested against reality, not against its own class definition.**
  The rule "deactivating a service with future appointments requires
  confirmation" has no real bookings to test against yet — the booking write
  path doesn't exist. Rather than constructing the error object directly (which
  proves the class has a field, not that the gate fires), the test inserts a
  real appointment row straight into the database, bypassing the application
  entirely, and proves the actual function refuses and then yields under
  confirmation.
- **The same defect, caught for the third time, and fixed differently each
  time it escalated.** A CI failure that looks exactly like a timezone bug
  and isn't one had already happened twice this project (parallel unit-test
  files racing each other; sequential unit-test runs leaving pollution for the
  next). This time it was end-to-end tests: different browser specs mutating
  the same global rows with no per-test isolation. Rather than patch the
  symptom a third time, the fix generalized: every e2e spec now resets the
  database in a `beforeEach`, the same discipline the unit suite already had.
  The suite got noticeably faster as a direct consequence — proof the fix
  was addressing real waste, not just correctness.

---

## A-007 — The availability model

**What it is:** the precedence chain that decides when a provider is actually
available — weekly hours, per-date overrides, breaks, time off — resolved
against the business's own opening hours.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **The whole chain is computed in wall-clock minutes, and that is the design
  decision.** A window is minutes-from-local-midnight (an overnight close of
  `02:00` is 1560, not 120), so the arithmetic never touches a timezone at all.
  "Dana works Tuesdays 9–5" is a claim about the wall clock that stays true
  whatever the offset does that week — resolving it to actual instants is one
  separate, already-tested step. Keeping those two apart is what makes the
  daylight-saving edge cases someone else's solved problem rather than this
  module's recurring bug.
- **"Closed" and "no override" are deliberately different states.** A day with
  an explicit closure and a day with no special rule both produce zero
  available hours, but they are not the same fact, and collapsing them is how a
  public holiday silently becomes an ordinary working day next year. The schema
  represents both and the resolver preserves the distinction.
- **An override replaces, never merges.** "Open 10–2 on Christmas Eve" means
  exactly 10–2 — not 10–2 plus the usual 9–5. Easy to get wrong, and the wrong
  version books clients into hours nobody agreed to work.
- **Availability is the intersection of business and provider hours, not the
  union.** The salon being open is a precondition for a stylist working, so one
  business holiday closes everyone's day regardless of their individual
  patterns — with an explicit test for exactly that.
- **Recording time off over existing appointments SUCCEEDS, on purpose.**
  "Dana called in sick" must never be refused because she has nine appointments
  booked; what happens to those nine is a decision for a person, surfaced as an
  impact preview. There is a test asserting the *absence* of a refusal — the
  requirement is that nothing is silently cancelled, so the non-refusal is
  tested as deliberately as any behaviour.
- **The tests were mutation-checked.** Three deliberate bugs injected into the
  precedence logic — intersection turned into union, override merging instead
  of replacing, and out-of-range breaks silently dropped — all three caught.

---

## A-026 — The availability adapter

**What it is:** the seam where the availability rules, the appointment rows and
the pure slot engine finally meet — and the single highest-risk query in the
project after the no-double-booking constraint itself.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **One query with two independent ways to be silently wrong, both guarded and
  both mutation-tested.** First, it must be an *instant-overlap* predicate
  rather than a date filter: a booking starting 23:30 and running past midnight
  belongs to both days, and a date filter drops it from the second one, after
  which the engine cheerfully offers midnight to the next customer. Second, and
  subtler, it must read the override column — a staff double-book deliberately
  stores a **zero-width** time range so the database constraint stays absolute
  without refusing the override, which means a busy-set built the obvious way
  returns an interval occupying no time at all, and the public booking page
  then offers the exact slot staff knowingly overbooked.
- **The proof that the test proves anything.** The override test asserts the
  *fixture* first — that the row's own range really is empty and the override
  column really is populated — before asserting the query picks it up. Without
  that, the test would pass just as happily against a fixture that was written
  wrong, which is the most common way a test about an edge case ends up
  testing nothing.
- **Deliberately mutation-tested.** Two real bugs injected: dropping the
  override handling, and hand-typing a status list that forgets that
  "completed" and "no-show" appointments still occupy their time. Both caught.
- **The unsafe option is not the default.** One flag controls both whether the
  booking horizon applies and whether internal exclusion reasons are exposed —
  and it defaults to the *public*, restricted treatment. A route that forgets
  to set it gets the safe behaviour, rather than leaking "overlaps-booking" to
  an anonymous visitor, which would tell them precisely when a stylist is with
  a client.
- **The date picker runs the real engine, not an approximation.** Computing
  "which days have availability" a cheaper way produces a calendar that greys
  out days the booking page will happily sell, or offers days it then refuses —
  a class of bug users experience as the software being broken.

---

## A-009 — The booking write path

**What it is:** the transaction that turns a chosen slot into an appointment —
and the concurrency story that makes double-booking impossible rather than
unlikely.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **Three defences, in a deliberate order.** A database exclusion constraint
  (absolute, enforced against every path including a `psql` session), an
  advisory lock scoped to one provider-day, and an engine re-run inside the
  transaction. The lock is explicitly *not* the correctness mechanism — it
  exists to close the one gap the constraint deliberately does not cover,
  because a staff override stores a zero-width range so the constraint won't
  refuse it, which means only the re-check defends that time.
- **The race tests script interleavings rather than sampling them.** Two real
  database connections, explicit happens-before edges, no `setTimeout` and no
  polling — including one that proves a blocked transaction *fails* when the
  winner commits, and one that proves it *succeeds* when the winner rolls
  back. That second case is the difference between a system where an
  abandoned checkout frees the slot and one where it kills it forever.
- **Mutation testing found two real bugs by NOT failing.** Deliberately
  breaking the code and watching the tests still pass is the only way to learn
  that a behaviour is asserted nowhere. It surfaced that the advisory lock
  bucketed by *UTC* day rather than business day — so two bookings on the same
  evening either side of UTC midnight were never serialized, exactly the case
  the lock existed for — and that the write path read the system clock, making
  it untestable against a fixed date.
- **Reaching unreachable code, honestly.** Once the lock works, the
  constraint-violation path becomes unreachable through the normal flow, which
  makes its error mapping untestable. Rather than delete the mapping or assert
  it by inspection, there is a deliberately ugly, clearly-named test seam that
  skips serialization — because untested defence-in-depth is just an untested
  branch, and the requirement was explicitly to provoke a *real* constraint
  violation and prove it becomes a clean "that time has just been taken"
  rather than a 500.
- **The confirmation is enqueued inside the booking transaction.** A booking
  can never commit without its confirmation, nor a confirmation without its
  booking — and a walk-in with no phone number on file still books
  successfully, with the notification recorded as suppressed rather than the
  booking failing.

---

## A-028 — Multi-service visits

**What it is:** "cut then colour" as one appointment rather than two — which is
half the sample salon's Saturday, and which the database actively refuses to
model the obvious way.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **The interesting rule is a subtraction, not an addition.** Durations sum,
  but the buffers between services do *not* stack. A buffer protects the gap
  between two clients — tidying the chair, washing the bowl. Inside one visit
  the client never leaves, so the second service's "10 minutes before" is time
  the stylist is already standing there with her. Stacking them would quietly
  add half an hour of dead time to every combination booking, and the salon
  would just notice its day stopped fitting.
- **It required no change to the scheduling engine at all.** Because a
  composed visit is simply a longer service with one buffer at each end, the
  whole feature lands as a composition function plus a plural field — which is
  the payoff for having shaped the data model plurally from the start, before
  anything needed it.
- **Order is part of the meaning.** Since the buffers come from the two ends,
  "cut then colour" and "colour then cut" produce genuinely different blocked
  ranges. That means caller order has to survive the round trip through the
  database, where the obvious query returns rows in storage order and would
  silently reorder someone's appointment. There is a test for it.
- **The old field was replaced, not supplemented.** Adding an optional
  "additional services" list beside the existing single one would have been the
  smaller diff and the worse design — two ways to express one thing is the kind
  of flexibility that quietly rots. Changing the canonical shape made the
  compiler enumerate every call site, which is exactly what should happen.
