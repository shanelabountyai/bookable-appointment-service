# Release Notes — Bookable

Portfolio-facing log: what got built and why it's a genuine engineering artifact,
not scaffolding. Written for "walk me through something you built" — pair with
`docs/PROGRESS.md` (the mechanical build log: decisions, what was left behind)
and `docs/reviews/03-slot-engine-spec.md` (the deepest technical spec in the repo).

Updated once per backlog item, same cadence as `PROGRESS.md`.

## A-001 — Monorepo & app scaffold

**What it is:** Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript in `apps/web`, Prisma +
Postgres in `packages/db`, the pure-function domain core in `packages/core`,
npm workspaces tying them together. Playwright + axe for e2e/accessibility.
CI that migrates a throwaway Postgres from scratch (drift check) and runs the
unit suite under two timezones.

**Why it's not boilerplate — talking points:**
- **CI runs the test suite twice, under `TZ=UTC` and `TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati`**
  (UTC+14, the calendar's extreme edge) and asserts identical results. A
  UTC-only CI is the single most common way a timezone bug ships silently —
  this repo's CI is built to make that impossible from commit one, before a
  single time-handling line exists.
- **Postgres from commit one, not "SQLite for now."** The project's core
  correctness guarantee (no double-booked appointments) is a database
  exclusion constraint (`EXCLUDE ... WITH &&`), which SQLite cannot express
  and cannot meaningfully race-test (one writer per file makes the concurrency
  test measure the storage engine, not the code). Choosing the harder-to-set-up
  database was the correct engineering call, not the default one.
- **Local Postgres for every test run, zero exceptions.** `.env.test`
  overrides only the database URL and inherits everything else from
  `.env.local` — a deliberate first-file-wins `dotenv` layering, not an
  accident of config order.
- **One fixed port, in config, never on the command line.** `next dev -p 3300`
  is written into `package.json`, not passed as an env var — the failure mode
  it avoids (two projects silently testing against each other's dev server
  because Playwright adopted whatever was already listening on the shared
  default port) is a real incident from a sibling build in this series.
